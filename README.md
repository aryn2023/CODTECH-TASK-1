**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**
**Project**: Simple Calculator
### Objective
The objective of a simple calculator is to provide a straightforward and efficient tool for performing basic arithmetic operations. These include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The main purposes are:
1. **Ease of Use**: Allow users to quickly and easily calculate results without the need for complex tools or extensive training.
   
2. **Accuracy**: Provide precise results for mathematical operations.

3. **Efficiency**: Save time by automating calculations, eliminating manual computation errors.

4. **Accessibility**: Serve as a foundational tool for learning basic arithmetic or handling day-to-day mathematical tasks.

5. **Versatility**: Offer support for a variety of mathematical operations, which can be expanded to include more advanced functions like exponentiation, square roots, etc., in more complex versions. 


### How It Works:
1. The user is prompted to select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
2. The program then asks for two numbers as input.
3. It performs the selected operation and displays the result.
4. If the user selects an invalid operation or inputs invalid values, the program gracefully handles the error.
